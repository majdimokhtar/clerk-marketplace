# Online Marketplace using Clerk and T3 Stack


Welcome to the Online Marketplace GitHub repository! This project is an interactive and dynamic online marketplace, built using Clerk authentication and the T3 Stack, which combines Next.js, React, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to buy and sell products in a secure and user-friendly environment.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** The marketplace utilizes Clerk authentication to provide a secure and easy-to-use login and registration system for users. This ensures that user data is protected and accessible only to authorized individuals.

- **Product Listings:** Sellers can easily create product listings, providing a title, description, price, and other relevant details about the product they wish to sell. Buyers can browse through the available listings and make purchases as per their preferences.

- **Shopping Cart:** The application includes a shopping cart feature that allows users to add products, remove items, and update quantities before proceeding to checkout.

- **Order Management:** Users can keep track of their orders and view their order history. Sellers can manage orders, update order status, and communicate with buyers via built-in messaging.

- **Search and Filters:** The marketplace incorporates search and filtering functionalities to help users find specific products efficiently based on various criteria such as category, price range, and more.

- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices, ensuring a seamless experience for both desktop and mobile users.

## Tech Stack

The project leverages the power of the T3 Stack, combining the following technologies:

- **Next.js:** A popular and powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, optimized performance, and easy routing for a smoother user experience.

- **React:** The frontend is built using React, providing a modular and component-based architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability.

- **Prisma:** A modern and type-safe database toolkit that simplifies database operations and enables seamless integration with various databases.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the styling process, allowing for quick and customizable designs without compromising on performance.

- **Clerk:** The authentication and user management system that ensures secure login, registration, and access control for users.
